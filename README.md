# Ant Colony Simulation

This project simulates ant colony behavior. Ants search for food, create and follow pheromone trails, and avoid collisions. The simulation uses PyGame for graphics and SciPy to model pheromone decay.

## Features
- Random ant movement with Gaussian noise
- Pheromone trails that fade over time
- Collision detection and response between ants
- Interactive food placement (mouse click) and adjustable time step

## Installation and Running
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmadAbushawar/Ant-Colony-Simulation.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame scipy numpy
3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
